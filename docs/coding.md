# Coding Convention

## Overall
- remove dependency between the codes as much as possible
- low level code must compile C++98
- use double space for a tab


## Element Indexing Rule

Based on the elemnt index rule in [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf)

## Coordinate for the Depth Computation

## Naming Convention (cpp)

use the extension ".h" instead of ".hpp"

filename should be in lower case. The underscore represent depndency. For example "aa_bb.cpp" means this is a implementation of class "aaa" and it depends on a class "bbb"

The function name should be written in camel case notation that sarts with upper case letter (e.g., Verb_Object_Adverb)

Geometric Operator

- Nearest
- Intersection
- IsInside
- Volume
- Area

Use Read <-> Write for the file io. Don't use Load <-> Save

Naming Various Types of Points

  - aXY -> general 2D point
  - aXYZ-> general 3D point
  - CAD vertex -> Vertex
  - Mesh corner point -> Point
  - FEM points it can be inside an element (may be on edge or on face) -> Node
